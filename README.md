# React Router v6 Overlapping Routes Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 involving overlapping routes.  The problem arises when defining routes that share a common prefix, leading to unexpected routing behavior.

## Problem Description

The `App.js` file contains routes that conflict. The route `/about/*` overlaps with `/about`. This means that when a user navigates to `/about`, the route  `/about/*` will also be considered a match and might cause unexpected rendering behavior or routing problems. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by restructuring the route definitions. In this case the order of the routes is crucial. The more specific routes should be defined before the less specific ones.
